    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These shredded Brussels sprouts with bacon and pine nuts taste fantastic! When I mentioned bringing Brussels sprouts to a holiday get-together, my mom told me not to bother. After eating this dish, my family now requests I bring this dish to every get-together!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ pound sliced bacon</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
        <li>⅔ cup pine nuts</li>
        <li>2 pounds Brussels sprouts, cored and shredded</li>
        <li>3 green onions, minced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon seasoning salt</li>
        <li>pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until crisp. Drain, reserving 2 tablespoons of grease in the skillet, crumble and set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt butter with reserved bacon grease in the same skillet over medium heat. Add pine nuts; cook and stir until browned. Add Brussels sprouts and green onions; season with seasoning salt and pepper. Cook over medium heat until sprouts are wilted and tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in crumbled bacon just before serving.</li>
